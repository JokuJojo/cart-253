The goal isn't to be be an educative game, but more of a fun 
rhyme with some slight brainrot/meme language. 

Female frogs scream in the night to attract a mate, which they are very picky and will usually scream for 3-4 nights before selecting a male. The male beauty standard being big and plump. Which female frogs are actually much bigger than male frogs. 

When the reject a male, they usually pretend to be dead as they wait for the male to realize and lose interest. (Or, and this is real, they've realized the male frogs will pretty much hump anything so they'll trick them into humping a rock or even another male frog, which that humped male frog will do a deep croak to signal "Hey dude you're barking at the wrong tree" which the females then started also using that same deep croak to trick the male frogs into thinking they're humping a male. Not in the game, just a fun fact.)
